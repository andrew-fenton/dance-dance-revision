Dance-Dance ReVision brings you the classic Dance-Dance Revolution arcade rhythm game right to your computer. Using computer vision, the app tracks real-time body movements as you dance to match arrows coming in! The arrows are synchronized with the beat, challenging players to hit the perfect moves anywhere without paying for the arcade, a new Just Dance CD, or sometimes $20,000+ for a new DDR machine!
